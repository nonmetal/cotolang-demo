### Key Components

#### Voice Widget (`components/voice-widget.tsx`)
- Manages call state and controls
- Displays real-time transcripts
- Handles microphone permissions

#### Vapi Webhook (`app/api/vapi-webhook/route.ts`)
- Processes voice interaction events
- Handles function calls for curriculum data
- Manages call status updates
- Provides language learning context

#### Curriculum Integration
- Connects voice assistant to curriculum agent
- Provides learning objectives during voice calls
- Offers cultural context and corrections
- Adapts difficulty based on user level

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Issues
- **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
- **No voice response**: Verify Vapi credentials and internet connection
- **Call won't start**: Ensure curriculum agent is running on port 8000

### Curriculum Issues
- **No learning objectives**: Check if curriculum agent is running
- **Connection errors**: Verify localhost:8000 is accessible

### General Issues
- **Dependency conflicts**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- **TypeScript errors**: Check for missing type definitions
- **Build issues**: Clear `.next` directory and reinstall dependencies
